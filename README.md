basic turtle crossing game

day 21 on coding python. Today i made my second basic project.
It's a turtle crossing game.
All you have to do is make sure your turtle went to the other side. 
Every time  the turtle go to the other side  the level and speed of the cars will automatically increase. 

Again and again it is not a complicated code. I'm very rookie at Python and even coding.
